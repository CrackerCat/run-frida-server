# Just download and run `frida-server`

This easy installation was exactly what I needed some time ago, and I didn't find a wrapper to make this happen. So I create this simple code to simplify this process.

## Features

- Detect multiple AVD instances;
- Detect AVD processor ABI;
- Always install the latest `frida-server` for this specific ABI.
